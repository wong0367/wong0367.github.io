            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>
                Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm Amy, and I'm thrilled to have you here. I'm a student of Algonquin College and I am studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. My birthday is on 18 <sup>th</sup> January and I am a Capricorn. I like reading books and watching movies when I have time. Here is one of my favourite quote from movie "The Help":
            </p>

            <blockquote>

                <p>
                    "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."
        
                </p>
        
                <cite>- The Help</cite> 

            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This inspiring quote resonates deeply with me as it reflects my commitment to pursuing my dreams. My aspiration is to become a <em>UX designer</em> dedicated to crafting authentic and user-friendly products. As I embark on my college journey, I eagerly anticipate expanding my skills and knowledge in this field, equipping myself with the necessary tools to thrive in my future career.
